  description: "Adaptive immunity in bacteria is accomplished by the CRISPR system, and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas). Proteins coupled with RNA are guided by this system to recognize and cleave foreign genetic material. As such, itâ€™s also a powerful method for genome editing, and is receiving lot of bio technical and medical attention currently. By using single molecule FRET we can study this system in greater detail."
