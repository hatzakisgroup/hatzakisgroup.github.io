<p>There are two ways to join our community, corresponding to different degrees of
involvement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<a href="https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/recon-forum">mailing list</a> 
and getting involved in discussions on our
<a href="https://reconhub.slack.com">Slack organisation</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a <em>member</em>, who actively contributes to the development of analytics
resources for RECON’s areas of interest; this is typically more involved but
also offers advantages reserved to members; see the <em>Becoming a member</em>
section below</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="becoming-a-member">Becoming a member</h2>

<h3 id="who-are-our-members">Who are our members?</h3>

<p><a href="../people">Our members</a> form the backbone of RECON. They are actively involved in the
development of analytics tools, contribute free and open training material, run
our workshops, teach at our short courses, or are deployed to the field where
they battle-test our resources to inform the response to disease outbreaks,
health emergencies, and humanitarian crises. Through votes at our annual General
Assembly, they can shape activities of RECON, and are also elligible for roles
in the Executive Board.</p>

<h3 id="why-become-a-member">Why become a member?</h3>

<p>Members benefit from a number of advantages; they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend and vote at general assemblies to shape the activities of RECON</li>
  <li>be candidates to any post of the executive board during its election</li>
  <li>have free access to the RECON mailing lists and forums</li>
  <li>advertise their work, when in line with the remit of RECON, on the association
media, including newsletters, mailing lists, discussion forums, blogs and
websites</li>
  <li>possess a confidential list of other RECON members to facilitate networking
within the association</li>
  <li>attend meetings not otherwise open to the public, such as internal training
workshops, hackathons and retreats organised by the association</li>
  <li>typically get a discount on RECON events where a registration fee applies</li>
  <li>apply for, and benefit from internal resources of RECON (e.g. funding,
equipment)</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits to members are formally defined in <em>Article 5.4</em> of our 
<a href="documents/statutes_en_1.1.pdf">statutes</a></p>
