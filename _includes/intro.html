                The main objective of our lab is to augment our understanding on the inner workings of enzymes and
                decode how conformational dynamics encode enzymes’ capacity to accelerate chemical transformations while
                maintaining the functional plasticity of accepting structurally diverse substrates. Harnessing this
                knowledge is the founding step to tackle the daunting tasks of a) design novel drugs <i>in silico</i>
                and b) the design of novel biocatalysts with tailor made functionalities.
                <br><br>
                We approach this formidable challenge by an eclectic mix of techniques — borrowed from whichever area of
                experimental science that promises to shed light on the behaviour of enzymes. We emphasize on single
                molecule studies (functional, FRET, particle tracking) that offer the potential to directly observe the
                existence, quantify the abundance and dependence on mutations, of behaviors that were masked in
                conventional assays due to averaging a large number of unsynchronized molecules.
